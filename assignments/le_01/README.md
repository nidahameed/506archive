# SI 506: Lab Exercise 01

## This week's Lab Exercise

This week's lab exercise includes four (4) problems that focus on comments, variable
assignment, using built-in functions, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Background

SAB, SSWB, CCRB, OSCR - what? New students and veterans alike occasionally have trouble
deciphering the plethora of acronyms that the University of Michigan uses for its buildings,
locations and programs. This lab exercise will introduce some buildings, locations and their
abbreviations to you.

## 1.0 Problem 01 (5 Points)

Comment out (i.e., add a hash sign (#) as the first character on the line) the variable name and
assigned value that doesn't adhere to the Python variable naming rules and conventions.

:bulb: You may need to comment out more than one (1) variables. Make sure you comment the whole
line.

## 2.0 Problem 02 (5 Points)

Create a list. Name the list `valid_abbr` and add as elements those variables that are not
commented out in Problem 01.

:bulb: You must use **exactly the same** list name provided in the instructions in order to pass
the auto grader.

## 3.0 Problem 03 (5 Points)

Use the build-in function `len()` to return the number of elements in the list `valid_abbr`. Assign
the return value to a new variable named `valid_abbr_length`.

:bulb: You __must__ use the function `len()` to get the length of `valid_abbr` in order to pass
the auto grader.

## 4.0 Problem 03 (5 Points)

If we could distribute the students enrolled in SI 506 (n=225) across all buildings listed in
`valid_abbr`, what is the minimum number of students that each building must accommodate? Assign the
minimum number to a variable named `minimum`.

Example: if we use four (4) buildings to accommodate sixty-one (61) students, the minimum number of
students that one building must accommodate is fifteen (15, 15, 15, 16).

:bulb: Consider using **floor division** here.
