# SI 506: Lab Exercise 02

## This week's Lab Exercise

This week's lab exercise includes five (5) problems that focus on string
and list operations.

## 1.0 Problem 01 (4 Points)

The variable `sandwich_string` is a string with sandwich ingredients. Replace the ingredient < olives > with < tomato > and assign the new string object to a variable named `sandwich_replace`.

## 2.0 Problem 02 (4 Points)

Create a list by splitting the string, `sandwich_replace`. Assign this list to a new variable named `sandwich_list`.

:bulb: Watch for spaces when using the `str.split()` function, the resultant list elements _must not_ have any leading or trailing spaces.

## 3.0 Problem 03 (4 Points)

Use the built-in list function `list.pop()` to remove the first ingredient in `sandwich_list`.

## 4.0 Problem 04 (4 Points)

Use the built-in list function `list.append()` to add an ingredient to `sandwich_list`. This
can be any ingredient you want to add to the sandwich.

## 5.0 Problem 05 (4 Points)

Use list indexing to assign the last item of `sandwich_list` to the variable `last_item`.
