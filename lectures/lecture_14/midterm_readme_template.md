# SI 506 Midterm XX

## 1.0 Overview

The midterm exam is open network, open readings, open notes, open slide decks. You may refer to
code in previous lecture exercises, lab exercises, and problem sets for inspiration. The midterm
is worth 1000 points and you accumulate points by passing a series of autograder tests.

## 2.0 A few rules

:exclamation: Please download the midterm files from Canvas Files as soon as they are
released. This is a timed event and delays in acquiring the assignment files will shorten the time
available to engage with the assignment. The clock is not your friend.

:exclamation: You are prohibited from soliciting assistance or accepting assistance from any person
while taking the exam. The midterm code that you submit _must_ be your own work. Likewise, you are
prohibited from assisting any other student required to take this exam. This includes those taking
the exam during the regular exam period, as well as those who may take the exam at another time
and/or place due to scheduling conflicts or other issues.

## 3.0 README and template files

In line with the weekly lab exercises and problem sets the midterm comprises a `README.md`
(this document) that contains assignment instructions together with a numbered `midterm_XX.py`
template file for you to write your code.

The template file contains a number of function definitions that you will implement along with a
`main()` function from which you will call the other functions, make variable assignments, and
perform other tasks in response to a series of challenges described below.

:warning: _DO NOT_ modify or remove the scaffolded code that we provide in the template unless
instructed to do so.

Implementing functions involves replacing the placeholder `pass` statement with working code. You
will call each function from `main()` passing arguments to the function and assigning the return
value to a specified variable per the instructions.

The template `*.py` file resembles the following skeletal implementation (verbose multi-line
Docstring instructions are shortened to a single line in the example):

```python
def some_function(some_parameter, another_parameter):
    """A description of expected behavior.

       Parameters:
            ...

        Returns:
            ...
    """

    pass # TODO Implement


def main():
    """Entry point for the program.

       Parameters:
            ...

        Returns:
            ...
    """

    # CHALLENGE 01

    # Manage execution flow per instructions.

    var_01 = None # TODO Call function; assign return value

    # . . .

    # CHALLENGE 08

    var_02 = None # TODO Call function; assign return value

    # Manage execution flow per instructions.


# Check if the Python interepreter knows this file as "__main__" (i.e., a script
# intended to be run from the command line). If True, call the main() function
# which serves as the entry point to the program.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## 4.0 Challenges

The midterm comprises a number of challenges. The teaching team recommends that you complete each
challenge in the order specified in this README.

The midterm is based in part on data drawn from . . . .

```python

## 5.0 Gradescope submissions

You may submit your problem solution to Gradescope as many times as needed before the expiration of
the exam time. Your __final__ submission will constitute your exam submission.

:warning: You _must_ submit your solution file to _Gradescope_ before the expiration of exam time.
Solution files submitted after the expiration of exam time will receive a zero score.

## 6.0 Auto grader / manual scoring

If the auto grader is unable to grade your submission successfully with a score of 1000 points the
teaching team will grade your submission __manually__. Partial credit __may__ be awarded for
submissions that fail one or more autograder tests if the teaching team (at their sole discretion)
deem a score adjustment warranted.

If you submit a partial solution, please include (if you have time) comments that explain what you
were attempting to accomplish in the area(s) of the program that are not working properly. We
will review your comments when determining partial credit.
